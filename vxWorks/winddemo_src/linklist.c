  * cell_3's information via cell_1's 'next' pointer. However, we can also 
  * view cell_2's information from cell_1 via a pointer-pointer: 
  *            i.e.  cell_1->next->next->element construct.
  *
  * (Ok, you caught me, this is actually a pointer to a structure which
  *  has a pointer that points to another structure, which also has a 
  *  pointer to yet another structure --- or a pointer-pointer-pointer)
  *
  * Like the previous steps, having 'cell' and 'cell_ptr' as watch-window
  * variables are useful for viewing the results.
